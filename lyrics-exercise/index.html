                    <h3>TRACK 14 ON HOZIER'S <i>UNREAL UNEARTH</i></h3>
                    <p>"As a kid I saw somebody running into traffic to try and pick up an animal that had just been hit by a car. This song looks at that memory in an abstract way and sees all of this tenderness and somebody going to great risk to try and offer some futile gesture of care towards a suffering thing. But it’s also about acceptance and letting go."</p>

                    <h4><span>[ VERSE 1 ]</span></h4>
                    <p>Sometimes it returns, like rain that you slept through<br>
                    That washed off the world, the streets looking brand new<br>
                    I will not be great, but I'm grateful to get through<br>
                    The feeling came late, I'm still glad I met you</p><br>
                    <h4><span>[ PRE-CHORUS ]</span></h4>
                    <p>The memory hurts but does me no harm<br>
                    Your hand in my pocket, to keep us both warm<br>
                    The poor thing in the road, its eye still glistening<br>
                    The cold wet of your nose, the earth from a distance</p><br>
                    <h4><span>[ CHORUS ]</span></h4>
                    <p>See how it shines<br>
                    See how it shines<br>
                    See how it shines<br>
                    See how it shines</p><br>
                    <h4><span>[ POST-CHORUS ]</span></h4>
                    <p>Oh-oh-ooh<br>
                    Oh-oh-ooh<br>
                    Oh-oh-ooh<br>
                    Oh-oh-ooh</p><br>
                    <h4><span>[ VERSE 2 ]</span></h4>
                    <p>Sometimes there's a thought like you choose what you're doing<br>
                    But it comes to naught when I look back through it<br>
                    I remember the view, streetlights in the dark blue<br>
                    The moment I knew I'd no choice but to love you</p><br>
                    <h4><span>[ PRE-CHORUS ]</span></h4>
                    <p>The speed that you moved, the screech of the cars<br>
                    The creature still moving, that slowed in your arms<br>
                    The fear in its eyes, gone out in an instant<br>
                    Your tear caught the light, the earth from a distance</p><br>
                    <h4><span>[ CHORUS ]</span></h4>
                    <p>See how it shines<br>
                    See how it shines<br>
                    See how it shines<br>
                    See how it shines</p><br>
                    <h4><span>[ POST-CHORUS ]</span></h4>
                    <p>Oh-oh-ooh<br>
                    Oh-oh-ooh<br>
                    Oh-oh-ooh<br>
                    Oh-oh-ooh</p><br>
                    <h4><span>[ BRIDGE ]</span></h4>
                    <p>Darling, there's a part of me<br>
                    I'm afraid will always be<br>
                    Trapped within an abstract from a moment of my life<br>
                    The weeds up through the concrete<br>
                    The traffic picking up speed<br>
                    All my love and terror balanced there between those eyes</p><br>
                    <h4><span>[ CHORUS ]</span></h4>
                    <p>See how it shines<br>
                    See how it shines</p>

                    <h4><i>ABOUT</i> THE SONG</h4>
                    <p>Released: August 18, 2023</p>
                    <p>The alternate title is ‘Psychopomp,’ which is a Greek term for a spirit guide—somebody who moves somebody from one part of life into the next. Charon the boatman would be a psychopomp, so it seemed appropriate for a memory of seeing somebody pick up a dead animal off a road and then place it on the sidewalk where it dies.</p>
