                    <li><p>My name is Maki Oh. I am a junior in Communication Design.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I have some experience in front-end coding. I am taking this class because it is a required course, but I'm interested in web design!</p></li>
                    <li><p>In terms of experience with HTML/CSS/JS, I have taken web design and computer science classes before.</p></li>
                    <li><p>One thing I hope to learn in this class is how to translate more complicated UX/UI designs to HTML and CSS.</p></li>
                    <li><p>One way I expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper is how usability needs to be considered, as well as how things look across different kinds of devices.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I think that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> exemplifies effective design because it focuses on usability, with clear navigation features and personalized features for different users.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I think that <a href="https://outlook.office.com/">Outlook</a> exemplifies effective communication because it is easy to navigate, even for new users. It has straightforward prompts and clearly communicates features with its users.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I think that <a href="https://www.sephora.com/">Sephora</a> is a website that works well because it has a clean, organized layout that does not overwhelm the user nor make it difficult tor read.</p></li>
