        <h1>Coffee Jelly</h1>
            <p>Coffee jelly is very easy to make: Sweeten strong coffee while heating it, then add a mixture of powdered gelatin and water and let it set up in the fridge. This recipe creates coffee jelly that is light and not too sweet, though you can adjust the sweetness to your liking. It's perfect for dessert, especially following a Japanese dinner in place of or alongside a cup of coffee. It's known as a refreshing Japanese summertime treat, but feel free to enjoy it all year long.</p>
        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin powder</li>
                <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                <li>2 cups brewed strong black coffee</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                <li>Whipped cream, optional</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the gelatin powder and water.</li>
                <li>Place the brewed coffee and sugar in a medium saucepan and bring to a near boil over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat, and whisk in the gelatin mixture until it dissolves. Set aside to cool, about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour the coffee gelatin mixture into a shallow baking dish (8- or 9-inch square or 11 x 7 inches) and refrigerate until set, about 5 hours.</li>
                <li>Once the coffee jelly has set, cut the gelatin into 1/2-inch cubes.</li>
                <li>Spoon the cubes into individual serving dishes and top with whipped cream, if desired.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>TIPS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This recipe requires strong coffee; if you can, use espresso as it will impart both rich flavor and wonderful aroma. Alternatively, brew coffee with a drip cone, moka pot, or French press as these nonelectric brewers produce a richer coffee than the standard drip machine.</li>
                <li>Leftover coffee jelly will keep in the fridge for up to two days when stored in an airtight container.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>RECIPE VARIATIONS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If you'd like sweeter coffee jelly, try an extra tablespoon of sugar and taste the coffee mixture (adding more if needed) before mixing it with the gelatin.
                <li>To make this recipe vegetarian, use agar-agar instead of gelatin.</li>
                <li>Instead of cutting into cubes, make individual servings by pouring the liquid mixture into small bowls or cups.</li>
                <li>Create a coffee experience by placing the cubes in a mug and adding some sweetened heavy cream or condensed milk.</li>

        <h2>3 LINKS TO RECIPE WEBSITES</h2>
            <h4>1. <a href="https://damndelicious.net/category/entree/quick-easy/">Damn Delicious</a></h4>
            <p>This site stood out to me as a good reference because of how clean the layout is; there is a nice balance of text and photos. There is also an option to jump directly to the recipe in case the user wants to skip unneccessary information, as well as pin the recipe to return to it later. </p>
            <h4>2. <a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/">Love and Lemons</a></h4>
            <p>This site stood out to me as a good reference because of how easy it is to navigate. It allows you to quickly navigate between different sections of the recipe, such as jumping to the instructions. It also offers similar recipes and serving tips.</p>
            <h4>3. <a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/">Minimalist Baker</a></h4>
            <p>This site stood out to me as a good reference because it balances subheadings and paragraph text nicely; the change in font weight and size allows the user to easily distinguish between sections of the recipe. There are also links to specific ingredients that the writer used.</p>
        <h2>3 LINKS TO NON-RECIPE WEBSITES</h2>
            <h4>1. <a href="https://www.etq-amsterdam.com/">ETQ</a></h4>
            <p>I would like to take inspiration from the clean, grid like format of this website. I think it is very effective in creating a clear sense of navigation and usability, as well as balancing text and image within a set space; I would like to convey similar movements in my own website.</p>
            <h4>2. <a href="https://www.zara.com/us/">ZARA</a></h4>
            <p>I would like to take inspiration from the way this site establishes negative space and how it uses thin boxes to outline large bodies of text. I think that the boxes create a clean foundation; without them, the text would have looked like it was floating on the page.</p>
            <h4>3. <a href="https://www.ideo.com/journal">IDEO</a></h4>
            <p>I would like to take inspiration from this site's style, specifically their creative, colorful look that implements both photography and illustration. I think I would like to include small, simple illustrations in my site like this one, as I feel like it conveys a sense of liveliness.</p>
